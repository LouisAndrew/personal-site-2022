<Layout title="My projects">
  <div>
    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      These projects are some of the projects that I want to particularly
      showcase
    </p>
    <div class="projects-grid">
      <a
        class="col-span-1 sm:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3"
        href={`/projects/this-project`}
      >
        <Card repositoryInfo={thisProjectInfo} />
      </a>
      {
        highlights.map((repo) => (
          <a href={`/projects/${repo.name}`}>
            <Card repositoryInfo={repo} />
          </a>
        ))
      }
    </div>

    <h2>Additional projects</h2>
    <p>
      These are the additional projects I were working on. These projects are
      often experimental and act as a way for me to learn new things.
    </p>
    <div class="projects-grid">
      {
        additional.map((repo) => (
          <a href={`${baseUrl}/projects/${repo.name}`}>
            <Card repositoryInfo={repo} />
          </a>
        ))
      }
    </div>

    <h2>Hidden projects</h2>
    <p>
      The projects from my GitHub profile that don't contain any description are
      hidden by default to prevent too much projects being displayed in this
      page. The hidden projects are usually projects that're used as a way for
      me to explore and learn new things.
    </p>
